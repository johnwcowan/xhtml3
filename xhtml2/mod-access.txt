     * 15.1. [10]The access element
          + 15.1.1. [11]Examples

   This section is normative for purposes of defining the integration of
   the XHTML Access Module into XHTML 2. The semantics of the XHTML Access
   Module itself are normatively defined in [[12]XHTMLACCESS].

   This module defines the [13]access element.

   Element Attributes Content Model
   [14]access [15]Common, [16]@activate, [17]@key, [18]@media, [19]@order,
   [20]@targetid, [21]@targetrole EMPTY

   Implementations: [22]RELAX NG, [23]XML Schema

   The [24]access element assigns a mapping between "keys" or other events
   to elements within a document. Actuating the mapping results in the
   element gaining focus and potentially in additional events being
   activated.

15.1. The access element

   The [25]access element assigns a mapping between "keys" or other events
   to elements within a document. Actuating the mapping results in the
   element gaining focus and potentially in additional events being
   activated.

   An access element must have either a targetrole or a targetid attribute
   specified. If neither a targetrole nor a targetid attribute are
   specified, the user agent MUST NOT define a mapping nor dispatch any
   events.

   The [26]access element allows an author to specify a relationship
   between "key(s)" or other events and one or more elements within a
   document. When a mapped event is triggered, one of the specified target
   elements gains focus, and one or more other events (such as an
   'activate' event) may also be dispatched to that element. The target
   elements are specified by means of the [27]@targetid or [28]@targetrole
   attributes, and these elements may each contain multiple targets, to
   allow sequential focus by successively triggering the associated key(s)
   or event(s).

   If the [29]access element's [30]@activate attribute has the value
   'true', then in addition to receiving focus, the target element will be
   activated, if permitted by the user's settings. Additionally, using XML
   Events [[31]XMLEVENTS], one or more other events may also be dispatched
   to the element.

   An access element must have either a [32]@targetrole or a [33]@targetid
   attribute specified. If neither a [34]@targetrole nor a [35]@targetid
   attribute are specified, or if there are no matching elements in the
   document, the user agent MUST NOT define a mapping for this element,
   nor change focus nor dispatch any events based on this element.

   Attributes

   The [36]Common collection
          A collection of other attribute collections, including:
          [37]Bi-directional, [38]Core, [39]Edit, [40]Embedding,
          [41]Events, [42]Forms, [43]Hypertext, [44]I18N, [45]Map,
          [46]Metainformation, and [47]Role

   activate = ( "true" | "false"* )
          The [48]@activate attribute indicates whether a target element
          should be activated or not once it obtains focus. The default
          value for this attribute is "false", indicating that the element
          will not be "activated". User agents MUST provide mechanisms for
          overriding the author setting with user-specified settings in
          order to ensure that the act of moving content focus does not
          cause the user agent to take any further action (as per
          Checkpoint 9.5 of UAAG 1.0 [[49]UAAG1]).

          User agents MUST provide keyboard mechanisms for "activating"
          any event associated with the focused element (as per Checkpoint
          1.2 of UAAG 1.0). User agents SHOULD make available the list of
          events associated with the focused element (as per Checkpoint
          9.6 of UAAG 1.0).

   key = [50]Characters
          This attribute assigns one or more key mappings to an access
          shortcut. The value of is attribute is one or more single
          characters from the document character set.

          The [51]@key attribute represents an abstraction. The use of the
          name "key" for this attribute is historical and does not mean
          that there is any association with a specific "key" on a
          keyboard, per se. It is up to the user agent to provide a
          mechanism for mapping the document character set value(s) of the
          attribute to the input methods available to the user agent. For
          instance, on some systems a user may have to press an "alt" or
          "cmd" key in addition to the access key. On other systems there
          may be voice commands, or gestures with a mouse, an eye tracking
          input device, etc. Regardless of the mechanism, the result is
          that it appears to the access element processor as if the
          defined key was entered.

          A user entering any of the keys defined in an access element
          moves focus from its current position to the next element in
          navigation order that has one of the referenced role or id
          values (see [52]@activate for information on how the element may
          be activated). Note that it is possible to deliver alternate
          events via [[53]XMLEVENTS]. Note also that the concept of
          navigation order is a property of the Host Language, and is not
          defined in this specification.

          User agents MUST provide mechanisms for overriding the author
          setting with user-specified settings in order to ensure that the
          act of moving content focus does not cause the user agent to
          take any further action, as required by UAAG 1.0, Checkpoint
          9.5. [[54]UAAG1] The character assigned to a key, and its
          relationship to a role or id attribute SHOULD be treated as an
          author suggestion. User agents MAY override any key assignment
          (e.g., if an assignment interferes with the operation of the
          user interface of the user agent, if the key is not available on
          a device, if a key is used by the operating environment). User
          agents MUST also allow users to override author assigned keys
          with their own key assignments (see Checkpoint 11.3 of UAAG
          1.0). If a user chooses to change the key binding, the resultant
          user-defined remapping SHOULD persist across sessions.

          If no [55]@key attribute is specified, the user agent SHOULD
          assign a key and alert the user to the key mapping. The
          resultant user agent assigned key mapping SHOULD persist across
          sessions.

          It is common for user agents to provide a visual hint for
          accessing features via keyboard shortcuts, such as showing the
          shortcut next to a menu item, or underlining the shortcut
          character letter in a label. The rendering of such visual hints
          about access keys depends on the user agent. We recommend that
          authors include the access key character in label text or
          wherever the access key is to apply. If the user agent can
          recognize that the currently mapped access key character appears
          in the label text of the element to which it is mapped, then the
          user agent may render the character in such a way as to
          emphasize its role as the access key and distinguish it from
          other characters (e.g., by underlining it).

          A conforming user agent SHOULD also provide a centralized view
          of the current access key assignments (see Checkpoint 11.1 and
          Checkpoint 11.2 of UAAG 1.0).

          Authors MUST NOT assign the same [56]@key value to more than one
          active access element. Note that it is possible to have an
          access element be inactive through the use of the [57]@media
          attribute.

   media = [58]MediaDesc
          The value of this attribute is a comma-separated list of media
          descriptors for which this access element is intended. When the
          value of this attribute matches the current processing media,
          the associated access element is considered active and processed
          normally; otherwise it is inactive and ignored. The default
          value for this attribute is all.

          Example

<style src="style.css" type="text/css" media="screen" />
<span src="photo.jpg" media="screen">Me at work</span>
<span src="photo-hires.jpg" media="print">Me at work</span>

   order = ( "document"* | "list" )
          The [59]@order attribute indicates how this access element
          should determine the navigation order for its matching elements.
          The default value, document, indicates that the items MUST be
          traversed in document order. The alternate value, list,
          indicates that the navigation order of matching elements is
          determined by the author-defined order of items in the list of
          [60]@targetid or [61]@targetrole attribute values.

          For the sake of determining navigation order, elements in the
          document that match the values in the [62]@targetid or
          [63]@targetrole attributes are called matching elements, and all
          elements that match the same value are members of an element
          group. Note: since the id of an element must be unique within a
          valid XML document, in such documents, each element group based
          on [64]@targetid values consist of no more than one matching
          element.

          For each navigation operation, the navigation order for both
          document-order and list-order is sensitive to the current focus
          element. For document-order, if no element currently has focus,
          the first matching element in the document MUST be the focus
          target; if an element does have focus, the next matching element
          in the document MUST be the focus target. For list-order, the
          focus target navigation order is determined as follows:

          + If no matching element of this access element currently has
            focus, the focus target MUST be the first element in document
            order that matches the first element group. If there is no
            such element, then the focus target is the first element that
            matches the second element group, and so on.
          + If a matching element of this access element already has
            focus:
              1. If there are additional matching elements of the same
                 element group in document order, then focus MUST be sent
                 to the next matching element of the same element group.
              2. Otherwise, focus MUST go to the first matching element
                 (in document order) of the next element group.
              3. If there are no remaining elements groups, then the
                 search MUST resume from the first element group.

          The location of the next matching element MUST be determined
          each time the access element is triggered, since it is possible
          that between events the contents of the document will have
          changed.

   targetid = [65]IDREF
          The [66]@targetid attribute specifies one or more space
          separated [67]IDREFs related to target elements for the
          associated event (i.e., the node to which the event should be
          delivered).

   targetrole = [68]CURIEs
          The [69]@targetrole attribute specifies space separated list of
          [70]CURIEs that maps to an element with a [71]@role attribute
          with the same value.

  15.1.1. Examples

   Access element that focuses into a field
<access key="s"
        title="Social Security Number"
        targetrole="ss:number" />

   Accessing a table of contents
<access key="c"
        title="Table of Contents"
        targetrole="toc" />

   Access that moves to the main content
<access key="m"
        title="Main content"
        targetrole="main" />

   Access that moves among form controls in document order
<access key="i"
        title="Form Controls"
        order="document"
        targetrole="button checkbox option radio textbox" />

   Access that moves among form controls in specific order
<access key="i"
        title="Form Controls"
        order="list"
        targetrole="button checkbox option radio textbox" />

   Access element that goes to a specific element
<access key="u"
        title="Username"
                targetid="username" />

   Access element with no specific key mapping
<access title="Navigation bar"
                targetrole="navigation" />
