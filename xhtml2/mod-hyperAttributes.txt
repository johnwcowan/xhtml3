                     13. XHTML Hypertext Attributes Module

   Contents
     * 13.1. [10]Hypertext Attribute Collection

   This section is normative.

   The Hypertext Attributes Module defines the [11]Hypertext attribute
   collection. This collection allows an element to be the start point of
   a hypertext link to a remote resource.

13.1. Hypertext Attribute Collection

   cite = [12]URI
          The value of this attribute is a [13]URI that designates a
          source document or message. This attribute is intended to give
          further information about the element's contents (e.g., the
          source from which a quotation was borrowed, or the reason text
          was inserted or deleted). User Agents MUST provide a means for
          the user to actuate the link.

          Example

cite="comments.html"

   href = [14]URI
          This attribute specifies a URI that is actuated when the element
          is activated.

          Actuation occurs as the default action of a [[15]DOM]
          DOMActivate event for the element on which the attribute occurs
          (for instance as the result of the user clicking on the
          associated element). If elements contained within an element
          using an [16]@href also use an [17]@href attribute, the User
          Agent must provide a mechanism for actuating any of these
          "nested" URIs.

          Example

<abbr href="http://www.w3.org/" title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr>
<li href="contents.xhtml">contents</li>
<a href="http://www.cwi.nl/~steven/amsterdam.html">Amsterdam</a>
<quote href="hamlet.xhtml#p2435">To be or not to be</quote>
<var href="#index_ninc">ninc</var>

   hreflang = [18]LanguageCodes
          This attribute specifies the primary language of the resource
          designated by [19]@href. At its most general, it is a
          comma-separated list of language ranges with optional accept
          parameters, as defined in section 14.4 of [[20]RFC2616] as the
          field value of the Accept-Language request header.

          In its simplest case, this is just a language code, such as
          "nl", but it may also contain variant specifications such as
          "en-gb".

          The user agent must use this list as the field value of the
          accept-language request header when requesting the resource
          using HTTP.

          If this attribute is not present, the user agent must use its
          default value of the accept-language request header.

          Example

<p href="http://www.w3.org/2003/06/semantictour-pressrelease"
   hreflang="fr">
   The press release in French
</p>

   hrefmedia = [21]MediaDesc
          This attribute indicates the type(s) of media to which to make
          available the content referenced by the associated [22]@href
          URI.

          Example

<p href="http://www.example.com/forPrinters.html"
   hrefmedia="print">
   A printable version of this page.
</p>

   hreftype = [23]ContentTypes
          This attribute specifies the allowable content types of the
          relevant [24]@href URI. See [25]ContentTypes for details of how
          it is used.

          Example

<p href="http://www.w3.org"
   hreftype="text/html,application/xhtml+xml">
   The W3C Home Page
</p>

   nextfocus = [26]IDREF
          This attribute specifies an IDREF of an element in the current
          document that will receive focus when the user requests that the
          user agent navigate to the next element that can receive focus.

          The sequence of [27]focusable elements is called the document's
          navigation order. The navigation order defines the order in
          which elements will receive focus when navigated by the user.
          The navigation order may include elements nested within other
          elements.

          When a document is first loaded, a user agent must do the
          following:

         1. If a document is loaded using a URI that includes a reference
            to a fragment identifier (such as book.html#chapter5)
              1. If the fragment reference identifies an element in the
                 document, the user agent must ensure that navigation
                 starts at the beginning of that element.
              2. If the referenced element is focusable, that element
                 receives focus.
              3. If the fragment reference does not resolve in the
                 document, the user agent must ensure navigation starts at
                 the beginning of the document.
         2. If there is no reference to a fragment identifier when the
            document is loaded:
              1. If the root element of the document has a [28]@nextfocus
                 attribute, and the element referred to by the attribute
                 is focusable, the element must receive focus. The user
                 agent must ensure the beginning of the element is visible
                 on the display.
              2. If the root element has no [29]@nextfocus attribute, no
                 element receives initial focus. The user agent must
                 ensure navigation starts at the beginning of the
                 document.
         3. If the user has moved away from the initial navigation point
            of a document (e.g., through using page up and page down or by
            changing focus), refreshing the document should result in the
            user's navigation location being preserved.

          In the event no element in the document has focus, when the user
          requests the next focusable element, that element must be the
          next focusable element forward from the current navigation point
          in document order. If there are no focusable elements before the
          end of the document, focus shifts to the first focusable element
          in document order. If a document has no focusable elements, then
          no element receives focus.

          Once a focusable element in the document has focus, upon
          requesting that focus change to the next focusable element, the
          user agent MUST follow these rules when determining where focus
          is next set:

         1. The next focus of an element without a [30]@nextfocus
            attribute is the next [31]focusable element in document order.
            If there are no remaining [32]focusable elements in document
            order, the next focus must be on the first [33]focusable
            element in document order.
         2. The next focus of an element with a [34]@nextfocus attribute
            is the element referenced by that attribute if it is
            [35]focusable, otherwise the next focus of that element.

          Regardless of the way in which an element receives focus, if the
          element is not currently visible on the user agent's display,
          the display must be updated so that the element is visible.

          The following example would allow the links to be navigated in
          column order (without the use of nextfocus they would be
          navigated in document, i.e. row, order):

          Example

<table>
<tr><td id="a" href="nw" nextfocus="b">NW</td>
    <td id="c" href="ne" nextfocus="d">NE</td></tr>
<tr><td id="b" href="sw" nextfocus="c">SW</td>
    <td id="d" href="se">SE</td></tr>
</table>

          Navigation keys. The actual key sequence that causes navigation
          or element activation depends on the configuration of the user
          agent (e.g., the "tab" key might be used for navigation and the
          "enter" key or "space" key used to activate a selected element).

   prevfocus = [36]IDREF
          This attribute specifies an IDREF of an element in the current
          document that will receive focus when the user requests that
          user agent navigate to the previous element that can receive
          focus.

          In the event no element in the document has focus, when the user
          requests the previous [37]focusable element, that element must
          be the next focusable element backward from the current
          navigation point in document order. If there is no such
          focusable element back to the start of the document, focus
          shifts to the last focusable element in document order. If a
          document has no focusable elements, the behavior is unspecified.

          Once a focusable element in the document has focus, upon
          requesting that focus change to the previous focusable element,
          the user agent must do the following:

         1. If the focused element has a [38]@prevfocus attribute that
            references a focusable element, focus is moved to that
            element.
         2. Otherwise, focus shifts to the previous focusable element in
            document order.
         3. If there are no previous focusable elements in document order,
            focus shifts to the last focusable element in document order.

          Regardless of the way in which an element receives focus, for
          visual user agents, if the element is not currently visible on
          the user agent's display, the display must be updated so that
          the element is visible.

   target = [39]HrefTarget
          This attribute identifies an environment that will act as the
          destination for a resource identified by a hyperlink when it is
          activated.

          This specification does not define how this attribute gets used,
          since that is defined by the environment that the hyperlink is
          actuated in. See for instance XFrames [[40]XFRAMES]. However,
          values of this attribute that begin with the character '_' are
          reserved.

          Example

<a href="home.html" target="main">Home</a>

   xml:base = [41]URI
          This attribute specifies the base URI from which to resolve
          relative URIs. It is normatively defined in [[42]XMLBASE]. Any
          relative URI used on an element that uses this attribute, or on
          an element contained within an element that uses this attribute,
          must be resolved relative to the base URI defined by this
          attribute.

          An element inherits URI base information according to the
          following order of precedence (highest to lowest):

         1. The [43]@xml:base attribute set for the element itself.
         2. The closest parent element that has the [44]@xml:base
            attribute set (i.e., the [45]@xml:base attribute is
            inherited).
         3. The HTTP "Content-Location" header (which may be configured in
            a server).
         4. The location of the document itself.

          Example

See:
<ul xml:base="http://www.w3.org">
<li href="/" src="Icons/w3c_home">The W3C home page</li>
<li href="/TR">The W3C Technical Reports page</li>
<li href="/Markup">The HTML home page</li>
<li href="/Markup/Forms">The XForms home page</li>
</ul>
